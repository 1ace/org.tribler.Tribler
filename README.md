Tribler
=======

*Towards making Bittorrent anonymous and impossible to shut down.*

We use our own dedicated Tor-like network for anonymous torrent downloading. We implemented and enhanced the *Tor protocol specifications* plus merged them with Bittorrent streaming. More info: https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki
Tribler includes our own Tor-like onion routing network with hidden services based seeding and end-to-end encryption, detailed specs: https://github.com/Tribler/tribler/wiki/Anonymous-Downloading-and-Streaming-specifications

The aim of Tribler is giving anonymous access to online (streaming) videos. We are trying to make privacy, strong cryptography and authentication the Internet norm.

Tribler currently offers a Youtube-style service. For instance, Bittorrent-compatible streaming, fast search, thumbnail previews and comments. For the past 11 years we have been building a very robust Peer-to-Peer system. Today Tribler is robust: "the only way to take Tribler down is to take The Internet down" (but a single software bug could end everything).
